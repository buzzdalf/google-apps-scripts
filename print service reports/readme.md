This folder contains 2 scripts being worked on for service.  The goal is to allow the team to generate shipping documents and automatically print them.  The script runs from a custom menu.
The script currently preapres al lthe reports and saves them as pdf.  Will implement the print feature once we have the ability to e-mail pdf attachments directly to printers.  Then I can just send the pdfs to a printer via email.

Concepts implemented:
- populate form tabs based on menu selection from currently selected row
- create a sub-folder on the drive to house the pdf files
- export spreadsheet forms to pdf to the new sub-folder directly
