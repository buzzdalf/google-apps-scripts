Script to read all data from an input sheet, find cells with time duration in min:sec.mmm format and convert them to sec.mmm format in an output sheet so the numbers can be used in calcuations.

Concepts implemented:
- converting spreadsheet data into arrays for manipulation, then writing the arrays back into spreadsheet
- finds all values containing duration times (searches strings for the : character)
