This script finds files in 3 specific folders based on search criteria (date, file type, file name), and sends an email to people who have their name on the email list.   This script executes on a scheduled trigger.
Concepts implemented:
- Searching google drive folders for files based on criteria
- file modify date check against criteria
- email, with addresses coming from a spreadsheet
- email error logging to a logging spreadsheet

This script is tied to this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X-OTk-1GbwYIABKtAIOt21sBW_5T7nrRmhCF3gu8fVo
