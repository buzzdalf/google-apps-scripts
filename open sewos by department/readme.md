This script goes through data on another spreadsheet to look for matching rows based on criteria.  When matches are found, certain cells from that data is copied into this spreadsheet.  The cells are then formatted based on contents.

Concepts implemented:
- read data from multiple spreadsheet tabs into arrays
- look for blank cells in specific array index locations
- populate new arrays based on criteria
- ouput array data to spreadsheet
- format cells based on criteria
- send emails based on information obtained in spreadsheet cells
- error logging email and spreadsheet

Note: This script is still in development.  It is working for 1 specific department, but not yet implemented to work on any department.
