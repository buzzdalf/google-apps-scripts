This is a script I made for someone that allowed them to use an iPad to tally defects on the line for a quality gate.  I can't remember what spreadsheet this was used for, and I do not own it - but the code may be helpful quickly rebuild something that tallies up different dfects based on simple button pushes.

Concepts implemented:
- increments counters based on pushing buttons
- totals up the tally on a sumamry sheet
