This script finds production counts based on the date.  It then copies and reformats those into a sheet that feeds graphs.  It runs nightly on a schedule.
This script also contains a function that finds today's date in the list and moves the cursor to that cell.  This function runs from a button.

Concepts implemented:
- searches spreadsheet for dates in a cell (including the year)
- copy data from one sheet to another based on date search
- moves active cell to current date
