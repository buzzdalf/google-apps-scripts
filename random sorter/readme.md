This script takes a list of items from column A, sorts it randomly, and puts the results in column B.  It runs from a custom menu.

Concepts implemented:
- reading a list, automatically determining the length of the list
- randomly sorting that list, with no duplicates (using an array)
- outputting the results into a new column
