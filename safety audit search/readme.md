This script helps the user find specific audits based on criteria.  It runs from a custom menu.  It then opens up a sidebar for user entry and executes the searches from the sidebar.

Concepts implemented:
- Creating a custom menu, tied to functions
- Implementing a sidebar
- custom styling (css) for the sidebar
- finding criteria for searches based on column headers, not specific columns (in case columns move)
- Building drop down lists in a sidebar dynamically based on spreadsheet data
- saving/retrieving user properties to build menus
- hiding/displaying sidebar elements based on search criteria
