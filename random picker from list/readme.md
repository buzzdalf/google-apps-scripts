This script randomly picks a "winner" from a list of entries in a spreadsheet.  It runs from a button and can either just pick a random item or run continuously, scrolling on the screen for visual effect, until the user cancels it.

Concepts implemented:
- random selection
- finding the max and min in a range
- incrementing to avoid duplicate winners
